      My name is Khin Maung Htet, and I'm a flexible programmer with a passion
      for good design and architecture. I'm a self-proclaimed nerd, and my
      primary goal is to build software that is both physically and digitally
      useful in our day-to-day lives. Although I have not yet had the
      opportunity to work on a team, I am eager to collaborate and am excited to
      work in an agile environment to develop innovative solutions to complex
      problems.
